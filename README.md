Copyright and licensing is difficult, especially when reusing software from different projects that are released under various different licenses.

REUSE was started by the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) to provide a set of recommendations to make licensing your Free Software projects easier. 

Not only do these recommendations make it easier for you to declare the licenses under which your works are released, but they also make it easier for a computer to understand how your project is licensed.

This specification defines a standardized method for declaring copyright and licensing for software projects.

The goal of the specification is to have unambiguous, human- and machine-readable copyright and licensing information for each individual file in a project.

Ideally this information is embedded into every file, so that the information is preserved when the file is copied and reused by third parties.

For example, REUSE specification expects

- All text files to include SPDX copyright & licences identifiers.
- Binary files to be accompanied by a `.license` file.
- All licence texts to be available under a folder LICENSES.

Reuse-tool is a simple python tool that validates that the project is REUSE compliant, and points the files for which some information is missing if not; available at https://github.com/fsfe/reuse-tool. 

Reuse tool an be installed using `pip install reuse`.

FOSSology currently uses old methods of defining licenses on source files. Following the REUSE specs, the code base of FOSSology should be updated with new licensing format.
