##  DESCRIPTION
Copyright and licensing is difficult, especially when reusing software from different projects that are released under various different licenses.

REUSE make it easier for us to declare the licenses under which our works are released, but they also make it easier for a computer to understand how your project is licensed.

FOSSology currently uses old methods of defining licenses on source files. Following the REUSE specs, the code base of FOSSology should be updated with new licensing format.
