# GSoC Week 8

## Updates

- Two happy moments for me this week:
    - I passed the midterm evaluation for Google Summer of Code 2022.
    - My first part of the project -  `Adopting the REUSE Standard in Fossology codebase` is completed and merged with the master branch. Now Fossology codebase is compliant with REUSE standards.
- I created documentation on Copyright and Licensing styles and presented it to mentors. Mentors were pleased with the documentation and asked me to update the reso agent's documentation as well.
-As I am unable to push the wiki changes into the Fossology repository, I asked mentors how to do so.
- I discussed with mentors whether it is necessary to trigger the copyright agent, even if it was not selected when the file was uploaded, in the case of the reso agent. Mentors advised not to do so now because it would create a problem with the clearing decision. If reso agent triggers copyright agent, it will also replace the previous status of clearing.
