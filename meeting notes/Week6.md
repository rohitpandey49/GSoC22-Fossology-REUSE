# GSoC Week 6

## Updates

- I raised two Pull Requests [#2263](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/2263) - `feat(reuse): REUSE best practices for licensing/copyright part-4` and [#2264](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/2264) - `feat(reuse): REUSE best practices for licensing/copyright part-5` for the REUSE standard. In PR #2264, REUSE-IgnoreStart and REUSE-IgnoreEnd in testdata files to ignore the contents of files.

- Worked on the Regex solution for SPDX Copyright identifier.

- For the GSoC project update, I've created a Github [repository](https://github.com/rohitpandey49/GSoC22-Fossology-REUSE) and shown it to the mentors for their feedback.

- On Medium, I wrote a blog about my [GSoC preparation journey](https://medium.com/@rohit-pandey/accepted-for-gsoc22-with-fossology-eddebf25f8ee).

- Several doubts on copyright agent clarified with mentors.

- Mentors provided guidance on how to copy copyright findings of the .license file to the associated files.

## Further Plans

- In the current week, I will work on second part of the project and documentationâ€‹
