# GSoC Week 3

## Updates

- Mentors reviewed pull request [#2238](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/2238) - `feat(reuse): REUSE best practices for licensing/copyright part-2` and suggested few changes.

- Current REUSE status
    ```
    When running reuse lint, the result is as follows:

    - Files with copyright information: 4065 / 4360
    - Files with license information: 3302 / 4360
    ```
- Few doubts were cleared regarding the comment formatting of the `nomos/agent/split_words`, `nomos/agent/GenCodeCopyright` and `ojo/agent/ojoregex.cc`.

- The merge conflict with the base branch was resolved with the help of Gaurav sir.
- Validated the correct header of License text files.

- We discussed the problem of bad licenses and missing license reports from reuse.software tools. In the next project meeting, we will try to find a solution.

- Gaurav sir suggested me to start work on the second part of GSOC project from fourth week.
